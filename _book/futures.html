<!-- The Bloomberg query Excel workbook for futures times series is available for download [here](./assets/workbooks/simple interface/futures.xlsm).  -->
<!-- ## Global futures settings -->
<!-- The global settings live on the worksheet named "query":  -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![Global settings](./assets/pics/Futures - settings.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- From there, input a start date and end date in the appropriate format (dd/mm/yyyy) as well as a frequency. The data are available at the daily (d), weekly (w), monthly (m) , quarterly (q) and yearly (y) frequencies. Start date, end date and frequency default to 01/01/1970, today's date and daily respectively.  -->
<!-- ## Futures series settings -->
<!-- Assets are mapped to "tickers" in the Bloomberg world. Querying futures data therefore requires the corresponding ticker(s) for the futures or futures series for which data is desired. Tickers can be found by opening a Bloomberg window and typing the name of the asset for which futures data is desired in the search bar, the futures' generic ticker will soon appear in the search results. Futures comes in series that include multiple contracts addressing various maturities over the same year. Each contract comes with its own ticker with the tickers for a series constructed on the same pattern and the only difference belonging to the contract's position on the term structure. For example, the generic ticker for the aluminium futures series, traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME), is "LAA Comdty". The ticker for nearby contract on this series (the contract with the shortest maturity) is "LA1 Comdty" while that for the second contract is "LA2 Comdty" and so on. Once collected, tickers can be used here to query time series data for the corresponding futures series. This workbook comes with an example query for some metal futures series traded on the LME, including aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, steel, tin and zinc. Click on the aluminium tab:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 1.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- The futures contract ticker goes in the top left cell ("A1"): "LA1 Comdty" is the ticker for the nearby contract on the LME aluminium term structure. -->
<!-- <br /> -->
<!-- Variables are mapped to codes in the Bloomberg world; codes for particular variables can be retrieved from a Bloomberg session by typing variable names in the search bar. The corresponding codes will soon be displayed in the search results. Once collected the codes can be used here to query firm level data. On a futures series' spreadsheet the variable codes go on the second row from column "B" onwards:  -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 2.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- In this example the variables queried for are volume ("PX_VOLUME"), open price ("PX_OPEN"), high price ("PX_HIGH"), low price ("PX_LOW") and close price ("PX_LAST").   -->
<!-- The data will be provided from the earliest date available on or after the start date provided. In this example data is provided from 1997 onwards while the start date for the query is January, 1^st^, 1990. These contracts were not yet traded on the LME in 1990, data is therefore provided from the earliest date for which there are quotation records in the Bloomberg database. Variables for which data is not available for particular dates will be shown as "#N/A N/A". In this example only the close price data is available from 1997; data for the other variables is only provided from 1998 onwards. Variables for which data is not available at the desired frequency will be provided at the highest frequency available with the corresponding figures repeated for all dates belonging to the corresponding period.   -->
<!-- Any number of variables can be added by inputting their codes in the next available columns. The open interest ("OPEN_INT") figure can be added as follows: -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 3.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- After the query is run the data shows up in the corresponding columns:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 4.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- Similarly any number of contract on the series can be added by inputting the corresponding ticker on the first row to the right of the rightmost data column, leaving one column blank, and copying and pasting the variable cells: -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 5.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- The input variables for the leftmost contract apply for all the contracts in the series. After the query is run the data shows up in the corresponding columns:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 6.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- Any number of futures series can be added. To add a series, create a new tab by clicking the plus icon to the right of the rightmost tab:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 7.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- Input the contract tickers and variable codes:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 8.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- The worksheet can be renamed by right-clicking on the corresponding tab:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 9.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- The query can then by run by going back to the "query tab" and clicking the "query" button:  -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 10.jpg) </center> <br />   -->
<!-- After a few seconds the data should be populated for all firms and variables:   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 11.jpg) </center>   -->
<!-- <br /> <center> ![](./assets/pics/Futures - series - 12.jpg) </center>   -->

<!-- ## Futures tool: what's coming next -->
<!-- The development of the Bloomberg query tool hereby put forward has now reached the beta version stage; the product is ready for being tested for feedback by end users. The next development stage will be dedicated to user experience, focussing in particular on improving the user interface. User navigation through the data sheets should be limited to the maximum and ideally would become irrelevant. This will be achieved by migrating all settings to the query sheet which shall become the sole interface to the end user:   -->

<p>The Bloomberg query Excel workbook for futures times series is available for download <a href="./assets/workbooks/advanced%20interface/futures.xlsm">here</a>. The user interface to the query engine lives on the “Query” worksheet:</p>

</center>
<div id="parameters-table" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Parameters table</h2>
<p>Parameters for the data query are set to the desired values in a dedicated table:</p>
<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20table%20-%20params.png" title="fig:Parameters" alt="Parameters table" />
</center>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start date</strong>: start date for the query in the following format: dd/mm/yyyy.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>End date</strong>: end date for the query in the following format: dd/mm/yyyy. If omitted, defaults to the current system date.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: frequency at which the data should be queried. Available frequencies are “d” (daily), “w” (weekly), “m” (monthly), “q” (quarterly), “y” (yearly).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Currency</strong>: currency for the query. If omitted, defaults to the default currency for the security as specified in Bloomberg.</li>
<li><strong>Term structure length</strong>: number of contracts in the various desired series to query data for starting from the nearby contract. Defaults to 5: queries data for the first five contracts on the term structure of the corresponding futures series.</li>
<li><strong>Roll type</strong>.<br />
Bloomberg allows to construct futures times series using a number of different roll methods. Rolling in futures parlance refers to the set of transaction that occurs when a position is moved from one futures to the next as the current position contract nears maturity. The query tool allows to run queries using all the roll methods available in Bloomberg at the time of writing; they include “Relative to Expiration”, “Fixed Day of Month”, “With Active Future”, “Relative to First Notice”, “At First Delivery” and “At Option Expiration”. Defaults to “With Active Future” (A).</li>
<li><strong>Roll delay - days</strong>: when constructing a futures times series with a “relative” roll type (“Relative to Expiration”, “Relative to First Notice”), allows to set the delay for the roll in days relative to the corresponding event.</li>
<li><strong>Roll delay - months</strong>: when constructing a futures times series with a “relative” roll type (“Relative to Expiration”, “Relative to First Notice”), allows to set the delay for the roll in months relative to the corresponding event.</li>
<li><strong>Roll adjustment method</strong>: Bloomberg allows to adjust the entire futures price series for the impact of the roll. Various methods are available to that end including “Difference”, “Ratio”, and “Average”. Further details on each of these can be found by <a href="./assets/workbooks/roll%20adjustment%20methods.xlsx">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="fields-table" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Fields table</h2>
<p>Similarly, desired variables for the query are inserted in a dedicated table:</p>
<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20table%20-%20fields.png" title="fig:Fields" alt="Fields table" />
</center>
<p>Variables or fields are mapped to “symbols” in Bloomberg. Symbols can be found by opening a Bloomberg window and typing a variable name in the search bar. In this example the variables queried for include close price (“PX_LAST”), volume (“PX_VOLUME”) and open interest (“OPEN_INT”). Variables for which data is not available at the desired frequency will be provided at the highest frequency available with the figures repeated for all missing dates to match the lowest frequency observed amongst the queried fields. Query fields are added or deleted by adding or removing rows from the table as desired. This is achieved by right clicking on a cell in the table, navigating to the “insert” tab and selecting the desired action:</p>
<ul>
<li>New query field:<br />

<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20table%20-%20add%20row.png" title="fig:Add field" alt="Add field" />
</center></li>
<li>Delete query field:<br />

<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20table%20-%20delete%20row.png" title="fig:Delete field" alt="Delete field" />
</center></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assets-table" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Assets table</h2>
<p>Assets are mapped to “tickers” in the Bloomberg world. Querying futures data therefore requires the corresponding ticker(s) for the futures series or set of futures series for which data is desired. The query engine uses the “active contract” ticker for a particular series. Tickers can be found by opening a Bloomberg window and typing the name of a futures underlying in the search bar, the “active contract” ticker for the series will soon appear in the search results. Active contract tickers are typically composed of three components; the first part of the ticker refers to the underlying name while the third refers to the underlying type with the two separated by an “A”. In the active contract ticker for the corn futures series for example, “C A Comdty”, “C” refers to “corn”, “Comdty” refers to the type of the underlying, a commodity in this case, and the “A” designates the ticker as the one for the “active contract” for the series. This workbook comes with an example query for corn (“C A Comdty”), soybeans (“S A Comdty”) and Crude oil (“CLA Comdty”). Tickers are added or deleted as desired in the same way as fields are dealt with in the corresponding table as demonstrated above.</p>
<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20table%20-%20tickers.png" title="fig:Tickers" alt="Tickers table" />
</center>
</div>
<div id="fetching-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Fetching data</h2>
<p>With the parameters, field symbols and futures active contract tickers inserted in the corresponding tables the query can be run by hitting the “Fetch” button on the top left corner of the spreadsheet. Tabs named after the futures active contract tickers appear to the left of the “Query” tab; for each of these the query engine assembles term structure contract tickers from the information provided in the parameters table, including the number of contracts on the term structure and roll methods and adjustments. For example, the ticker on the top left corner of the spreadsheet for crude oil (“CLA Comdty”) below, “CL1 A:00_0_N Comdty” refers to the first or nearby contract on the term structure (“1”) for the crude oil (“CL”) “commodity” (“Comdty”) where the roll follows that of the active contract for the series (“A”) with no delay, neither in days (“00”) nor in months (“0”) and no adjustement (“N”). After a few seconds each of the contract tickers is populated with data for the corresponding fields:</p>
<center>
<img src="assets/pics/Futures%20-%20series%20-%201.png" title="fig:Futures data" alt="Futures data" />
</center>
<p>With the data retrieved the query is now completed and the workbook can be saved. It can be updated at a later date by inputting a more recent date for the query “end date” in the parameters table or leaving the slot blank in which case data will be retrieved up to the current date.</p>
